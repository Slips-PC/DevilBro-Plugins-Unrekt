# Current Known Issues
~~You will have to manually install BDFDB. I am too lazy to find a fix for this, but it should work out of the box.~~ ~~BDFDB (speculation) adds malicious CSS to Lightcord, preventing the settings page from opening.~~ The tool to install BDFDB included within PluginRepo and other DevilBro plugins can **NOT** be used. The downloaded version of BDFDB from that button is the **UNMODIFIED VERSION**, and will render your Lightcord installation unusable (disabling access to the settings menu) bar a fresh install with a wiped plugins list.
